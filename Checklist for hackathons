[ ] Sign up for the hackathons
[ ] Depending on who gets accepted, we form teams
[ ] Have a meeting sometime before the hackathon to decide on ideas and teams
[ ] Decide on travel, fare and date

Teams:
1. Divide teams based on ideas
2. Divide on expertise (Newbie/Intermediate/Advanced) - I do prefer this one

# Travel more than 25 mi. from campus:

1. Paperwork needs to be completed
2. Members need to fill out a form too
